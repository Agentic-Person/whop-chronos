All right, so ladies and gentlemen, in
0:01
today's video, I'm going to show you how
0:02
to make $100,000 on **Whop**. And what an
0:05
amazing day for it. I was literally just
0:07
on calls with a team. And it's
0:08
unfortunate that I couldn't be there at
0:10
our New York offices today, but we just
0:12
crossed a billion dollar in GMV. And
0:15
what that means is that people have
0:17
earned a billion using **Whop**. And I know
0:20
you guys might take this video with a
0:22
pinch of salt considering I'm a coowner
0:23
in the company. I just made a huge
0:25
investment and annoyingly actually just
0:27
came back from New York to spend some
0:29
time with the team over there. Would
0:30
have absolutely loved to be there for
0:32
this milestone. But nonetheless, I hope
0:33
by the end of today's video, you can see
0:35
why **Whop** is so revolutionary and why it
0:38
is the company that I decided to put my
0:40
millions and millions and millions of
0:42
dollars of backing into. So, let's get
0:44
into it. Here is how **Whop** is changing how
0:46
people make money online right now. This
0:48
platform, as I said, has helped people
0:50
earn over a billion dollars by selling
0:52
courses, communities, digital products,
0:54
all under one roof. The opportunity is
0:56
truly massive. The digital product
0:58
market is exploding and set to hit $325
1:02
billion by the end of 2025, and **Whop** is
1:05
at the center of it all. You see, when
1:07
you list your products on **Whop’s**
1:08
marketplace, you immediately tap into a
1:10
massive audience of buyers with over 2
1:12
million weekly marketplace visitors. I
1:14
think the last time I checked, we're
1:15
selling about $3 to5 million a month. as
1:18
in getting people on who $3 to5 million
1:20
a month in sales of their digital
1:22
products. Now, if you're on this
1:24
business channel and if you're watching
1:25
this kind of video, I could assume that,
1:27
you know, you're the sort of person that
1:28
isn't just going to rely on that. I
1:29
mean, at the end of the day, you're
1:30
probably a very, very smart
1:31
entrepreneur. This channel is for
1:33
entrepreneurs doing over $250,000 a
1:36
year. But I know we have some crazy
1:37
heavy hitters watching this channel
1:38
making millions of dollars a year,
1:40
sometimes even tens of millions of
1:41
dollars a year. But the reason I say
1:42
this is because I really just want to
1:43
make it clear, the reach is unmatched.
1:45
nothing else gives you access to over 2
1:47
million weekly visitors who are actively
1:49
looking to buy dojo products and the
1:50
growth is clear. **Whop** is positioned to
1:52
become the dominant marketplace in the
1:54
industry. In fact, scratch that we are
1:56
the dominant player in the industry. So,
1:58
as I said, I invest in this company
1:59
because I truly believe this is where
2:00
the industry is headed. And what's cool
2:02
is because as a coner in the business, I
2:04
see data that no one else sees. I know
2:06
every single intimate part of the
2:08
business. I know exactly what's working
2:09
and what's not working as people are
2:11
making $und00 million a month on
2:12
**Whop**. And I know this video is going to age
2:14
very poorly because by the time that
2:15
you're watching this, people are
2:16
probably already making 300 400 $500
2:19
million a month from the platform.
2:20
Anyways, in today's video, I want to
2:22
break down how and why you should move
2:24
your business onto **Whop**. By the way, I want
2:25
to make something very clear. The switch
2:26
to **Whop** is dead simple. Okay? Other
2:28
platforms make you figure out everything
2:30
yourself. Not **Whop**. Our incredible
2:31
onboarding team has stripped away all
2:33
the BS. You can literally get your
2:35
account set up and your first product
2:37
live in 4 minutes. I'm I'm not kidding
2:38
here. 4 minutes flat. They have cut out
2:40
all the unnecessary steps that waste
2:42
your time. And by the way, we have an
2:43
in-house team that literally does all of
2:44
the heavy lifting. Okay? You don't need
2:46
to be some tech genius to make it
2:47
happen. If you're moving over for one of
2:48
the other platforms, I'm telling you
2:49
right now, literally any other platform,
2:51
we can get that done for you in a few
2:52
clicks. So, going back to the main point
2:54
of this video, as a co-owner who has
2:55
access to data that no one else sees,
2:57
I'm going to be giving you owner
2:58
insights throughout this tutorial. I'm
3:00
going to show you how to set up your
3:01
**Whop**, add apps to your **Whop**, get set up on
3:04
the marketplace, and optimize your
3:05
**Whop** with insider strategies, so that way
3:08
you're going to hit the $100,000 a month
3:09
run rate in no time. This information
3:11
you simply cannot get anywhere else.
3:14
This is basically like Jeff Bezos
3:15
telling you how to make money on Amazon.
3:16
Like I'm literally just peeling back the
3:18
curtain here. So anyways, let's get into
3:20
it. As an existing business owner,
3:22
you've already done all the hard work.
3:23
Okay, you've built products that sell
3:25
and have a customer base that trusts
3:26
you. Now it's time to leverage **Whop’s**
3:28
marketplace to scale your business to
3:30
$100,000 a month. So step number one,
3:31
very simple, set up your **Whop**. Setting up
3:33
your **Whop** store takes less than 5 minutes
3:34
from start to finish. The website is
3:36
going to guide you through the sign up
3:37
process naturally. But just in case you
3:39
want a little extra confirmation, here
3:40
is the step by step. You click the blue
3:42
sign up button. You enter your email and
3:43
your **Whop** will send you a confirmation
3:44
code. Enter that confirmation code and
3:46
voila, there you have it. Then you're
3:48
going to select create on the top
3:49
hand right corner. Then you're going to
3:51
be prompted to name your **Whop**. This is
3:52
just the name of your product/course or
3:54
service. In my case, I would name my
3:56
**Whop** either monetize 8 figure license or
3:58
digital launchpad. Now, very important
4:00
to note, you can now actually bring all
4:02
of your products under one roof. As an
4:04
existing business owner, you're probably
4:06
juggling a course platform, a membership
4:07
site, a payment processor, a community
4:09
platform, a landing page builder. With
4:10
**Whop**, all of these can live in one place.
4:13
Now, I want to make something very
4:14
clear. We have people who are making $10
4:15
million a month on **Whop** and some people
4:17
who are making $10 a month on **Whop**. We
4:19
really help people with whatever stage
4:20
you're at. So, maybe for you, you want
4:21
to use uh five out of 10 of the features
4:23
on **Whop**. Maybe you only want to use it for
4:25
one specific thing. In all honesty, we
4:27
have some people on **Whop** who only process
4:28
their payments on **Whop**. And we have the
4:30
most robust payment processing system in
4:32
the entire industry with more payment
4:34
options than you can know what to do
4:35
with. And what that does in terms of
4:37
your revenue and how much money you make
4:38
with, for example, some of the buy now
4:40
pay later options, the crypto options.
4:42
We just make it so ridiculously easy for
4:44
you to accept payments from your
4:45
customers. I know it's so crazy that
4:47
like when you're running a business at
4:48
the scale, you know, a lot of times
4:49
that's just one of the biggest issues
4:51
actually accepting payments from
4:52
customers from different countries,
4:54
offering different financing options,
4:55
things like that, and it sucks and we
4:57
basically just try to make it as easy
4:58
for you as humanly possible. So although
5:00
you can do literally everything on
5:02
**Whop**, you can also use it in a more modular
5:04
function if you wish to. Now, when it
5:05
comes to understanding the **Whop**
5:07
structure, each product gets its own **Whop**
5:09
within the **Whop** platform. Now, what's the
5:11
difference between a **Whop** and a
5:12
lowercase **whop**? Well, uppercase **Whop** is the
5:15
online platform of course, whereas
5:17
lowercase is your online hub. Really,
5:19
the space for your business and your
5:20
community. Then within each **Whop**, you add
5:21
the apps that you need. So, if you have
5:23
course, you have the courses app, chat,
5:25
chat app, forums app, one-on-one
5:27
coaching calls app, and listen, there's
5:28
so many more to pick from, and we're
5:30
going to get on to this later. Now, all
5:31
these apps put together within your
5:33
**Whop** create your product. Okay, once you've
5:35
created your **Whop**, you can check out the
5:36
to-do list setting at the bottom of the
5:38
page. These are the steps that you will
5:39
follow to design your store page. So,
5:41
let me run through them quickly. You're
5:42
going to add headline and description.
5:44
Your headline must promise a clear
5:45
outcome. Focus on the transformation,
5:47
not the information. Be specific with
5:48
numbers and time frames. Appeal to your
5:50
customers deepest desires. For example,
5:51
how to make $10,000 with an agency in 90
5:54
days. Build a six-figure coaching
5:55
business in 60 days. Lose 20 lbs in 8
5:57
weeks without counting calories. The
5:59
headline is the outcome that they will
6:01
receive. So, for the description, you
6:03
should explain a little bit about the
6:04
information that you're going to teach.
6:05
And B, include at least one risk
6:07
reversal or objection handler. Meaning,
6:09
a lot of people are going to read your
6:11
how to make $10,000 with an ad agency in
6:13
90 days, but they might think that it's
6:14
simply not for them, okay? Or they may
6:16
think that maybe you're not credible.
6:18
So, you need to go ahead and handle that
6:19
objection in the description. This is
6:21
standard textbook copyrightiting. For
6:23
example, how to make $10,000 with an ad
6:24
agency in 90 days without any money,
6:26
experience, or social media followers.
6:28
Then, lastly, you're going to add a
6:29
logo. Then, you're going to add gallery
6:31
images. The top performing **Whops** all use
6:33
video sales letters, okay, VSSLs, as
6:36
their gallery media. So, you want to
6:37
upload a 2 to three minute video that
6:39
explains what your **Whop** is about,
6:40
establishes who you are and why you're
6:42
qualified, as well as details the
6:43
specific outcomes that people will
6:45
receive. **Whops** with VSSLs convert
6:47
significantly better than static images.
6:49
Then, you're going to choose the
6:51
category. You see, your category
6:52
selection directly impacts your
6:53
visibility in the **Whop** marketplace. The
6:56
platform organizes **Whops** by category to
6:58
help 2 million weekly visitors discover
7:00
products that match their interests.
7:01
Choose a category that best represents
7:03
your **Whop’s** main value proposition. Popular
7:05
categories include social media,
7:07
trading, business, fitness. If your
7:09
product can fit multiple categories,
7:10
well then select the one that's most
7:12
aligned with your primary offering. Then
7:14
we move on to learn about me section.
7:16
You see, when potential customers are
7:17
considering your **Whop**, they need to
7:19
quickly understand who you are and why
7:21
they should trust you. The learn about
7:22
me section is your opportunity to
7:24
establish credibility. Click edit
7:26
creator details. Then step one,
7:27
highlight your relevant credentials.
7:29
Step two, tell your origin story. Step
7:31
three, link all social profiles. And
7:33
here you're just trying to show why
7:34
you're the authority in the space and
7:36
why they should listen to you. And then
7:37
next you want to add personas. This is
7:39
your target audience. The most
7:40
successful creators have three to four
7:42
distinct personas. You see, when
7:43
potential buyers land on your page,
7:45
they're going to be unsure if you can
7:46
actually help them. And this should
7:48
solidify that yes, it's actually made
7:50
exactly for them. Then you're going to
7:51
set up your pricing. Setting up your
7:53
pricing on **Whop** is very straightforward.
7:54
We give you tons of options. That's
7:56
always been very important to me as
7:57
someone who's made close to hund00
7:59
million with digital products is having
8:01
different pricing options. Okay. So, you
8:03
can decide between free, paid via single
8:05
payment or subscriptions. Now, you can
8:07
see some of the options right here.
8:08
You've got free, you've got paid,
8:09
subscription, or single payment. And
8:11
then from there, if it's a subscription,
8:12
do you want to add a free trial? Do you
8:13
want to add initial fee? Do you want to
8:14
enable split payment? Do you want to add
8:16
a weight list? Do you want to ask users
8:17
questions before purchasing? We give you
8:19
so many options because quite frankly,
8:21
that's what you deserve. If it's a
8:23
single payment, once again, do you want
8:24
to add a wait list? Do you want to ask
8:25
users questions before purchasing? Do
8:27
you want to allow ASSH payments? Do you
8:29
want to allow users to pay with their
8:30
PayPal account? Do you want to allow
8:31
users to pay with cryptocurrency through
8:33
Coinbased Commerce? There's so many
8:35
options, guys, here. Now, let's talk
8:36
about another incredible feature that
8:38
has really, really helped with Churn. Do
8:40
you want to offer discounts before users
8:42
cancel? You see, **Whop** offers several
8:44
advanced pricing mechanics worth
8:45
considering. You can implement
8:47
pre-ancellation discounts that
8:48
automatically offer users a reduced rate
8:51
before they leave. A tactic that, as I
8:53
said, significantly reduces churn. Then,
8:55
step number two, add apps to your **Whop**.
8:57
You see, now that you have your store
8:58
page built, you will want to start
9:00
building out your product by selecting
9:01
the apps you want to include. The first
9:03
few apps I include are the following.
9:04
Announcement app. I think that's very
9:06
important. You see, the announcement app
9:07
is powerful because it serves both as
9:09
internal communication tool as well as
9:11
external email system. You can actually
9:13
email all of your users anytime you make
9:15
an announcement. And by the way, this is
9:16
the only app that actually allows you to
9:18
do this. You have three email options.
9:20
Send emails for all admin posts, only
9:22
send weekly summaries, or disable emails
9:24
completely. Now, for maximum engagement,
9:26
I recommend using announcements very
9:27
strategically. Then, you want to create
9:29
a pinned welcome post. This should
9:30
explain how your **Whop** works and what
9:32
members can expect. Share success
9:33
stories. A lot of people join **Whops** to
9:35
learn a skill, and it can get very
9:37
dejecting if you're a few weeks in and
9:39
you're not seeing results. So, you can
9:40
actually use announcements to share
9:42
client wins to combat this. Then,
9:44
announce opportunities. For example, new
9:45
bounty, you just added a $100 reward for
9:47
members who create and share a case
9:49
study about implementing your
9:50
strategies. The top three submissions
9:52
will receive additional mentoring calls
9:53
with you as an example. The app even
9:55
allows you to create polls to gather
9:57
community feedback and set prices for
9:59
premium announcement content,
10:01
essentially creating a paid newsletter
10:03
right within your **Whop**. When configured
10:05
correctly, the announcement app becomes
10:06
your most powerful retention tool,
10:08
bringing members back into your **Whop**, even
10:10
when they've been inactive for days.
10:12
Then we move on to chat app. You see,
10:14
when creating a successful **Whop**, the chat
10:15
is absolutely essential for building a
10:18
thriving community that keeps members
10:19
coming back daily. Now, I'm just going
10:20
to tell you right now as a co-owner of
10:22
**Whop** I can tell you that the most
10:24
addicting **Whop** is one of the key marketplace
10:26
metrics that drives visibility and new
10:28
signups. This category within **Whop**
10:30
Marketplace actually ranks **Whops** based on
10:32
the average time users spend within your
10:35
**Whop** over the last 24 hours. The **Whops** that
10:37
consistently rank highest here typically
10:40
generate the most organic growth within
10:42
this category. Then we move on to a
10:44
course app. You see, the course app is a
10:46
powerful tool for delivering structured
10:47
content to your **Whop** members. Whether
10:49
it's your main product or an onboarding
10:51
resource, including well-designed
10:52
courses significantly increases both
10:54
user satisfaction and the perceived
10:56
value of your **Whop**. Now, let's run through
10:58
some key features. Sequential learning
11:00
require members to watch modules in
11:01
order, ensuring they master foundational
11:03
concepts before moving to advanced
11:05
topics. Content protection. You can
11:07
actually add unique overlays with your
11:09
company name to prevent content theft if
11:11
someone tries to screen record your
11:12
videos. We have a certificate system
11:14
where you can generate complete
11:16
certificates that members can showcase
11:18
increasing their motivation to finish
11:20
your course. The course app offers
11:21
multiple content types to enhance the
11:23
learning experience. So let's say for
11:25
example you have multimedia modules,
11:26
combined videos, downloadable files and
11:28
descriptions in a single lesson. You
11:30
have text only modules for documents and
11:31
written explanation. You have file
11:33
uploads for templates, worksheets and
11:34
resources. You also have knowledge
11:35
checks. This is very cool. You can
11:37
create quizzes to test comprehension and
11:39
ensure members are absorbing the
11:41
material. Then you've got the one-on-one
11:43
coaching call app. The one-on-one
11:45
coaching call app actually allows you to
11:46
offer personalized consultation sessions
11:49
directly through your **Whop**, creating an
11:51
additional revenue stream. Here are some
11:53
key features. You have calendar
11:54
integration. It connects directly with
11:56
your Google calendar, so bookings
11:57
automatically appear in your schedule
11:59
without any manual work. Flexible
12:00
pricing. You can set premium rates for
12:02
your time. For example, $1,500 per hour
12:04
for personalized consulting. Video
12:06
integration. It automatically includes
12:08
video links. So, Google Meet, Zoom or
12:10
Custom. When members book sessions, this
12:12
app actually eliminates the need for
12:14
external scheduling tools like
12:16
Calendarly while keeping all of your
12:17
business in one place. Members can book
12:19
and pay without leaving your **Whop**, creating
12:21
a seamless experience. Now, let's say,
12:23
for example, for agency owners and
12:24
consultants, this feature is
12:26
particularly valuable as it lets you
12:27
transition interested leads into paid
12:29
calls directly from your content with
12:31
zero platform fees beyond standard
12:34
commission. So listen, this is just like
12:35
why **Whop** is just the best because
12:38
let's say you have a thousand customers,
12:40
okay? You know, out of those thousand
12:41
customers, let's say you're selling
12:42
something, for example, for low ticket,
12:43
let's just call it $99 and you sell
12:45
a,000 people. Well, out of those
12:46
thousand people, I'm sure there's 10 or
12:47
20 or 30 or 50 or, you know, maybe even
12:49
10 a month that would love to have some
12:51
one-on-one coaching with you. Now,
12:52
rather than having to spend all this
12:53
time advertising and this and reaching
12:55
out and payment link and this that, it's
12:57
just all there directly as an app inside
12:59
of your **Whop**. And this is why truly we give
13:01
you guys so much flexibility, so many
13:03
options to grow your business in
13:04
whatever direction you want to take it
13:06
and whatever strategy. We don't want to
13:07
box you in with one pricing model, one
13:09
strategy, you know, no modularity. We
13:12
give you the tools because quite
13:13
frankly, as I said, that's what you
13:14
deserve as a business owner. Now, beyond
13:16
the core apps that we have covered, **Whop**
13:18
offers many more apps that integrate
13:19
straight into your product. You've got
13:21
content rewards, you've got the **Whop**
13:22
wheel, you've got files, you've got
13:24
guess the score, you've got bounties,
13:25
events, newsletters, softwares. Now
13:27
listen, a long time ago when I first
13:29
started looking into actually investing
13:30
into **Whop**, you know, obviously I'm
13:31
playing around with all these features
13:32
and a lot of these features. At first, I
13:33
was like, "Oh, well, this is a little
13:34
silly or this is a little childish, but
13:36
at the end of the day, you need to
13:37
understand that the more your users use
13:40
your product, the more money you make,
13:42
the better the satisfaction is." So,
13:43
there's so many gamification tools. You
13:45
know, if you look at, for example, one
13:46
of my other favorite companies, a
13:47
company called Duolingo, they do
13:49
gamification so well. They do it so on
13:51
point. And even, by the way, if you look
13:53
at a lot of these top gambling
13:54
companies, they gamify. They understand
13:56
how to keep people hooked and and
13:58
addicted. And you know what? Here at
13:59
**Whop**, I'm very happy that we keep people
14:00
hooked and addicted to learning and
14:02
community and expanding their mind and
14:04
connecting with people. Like, it's, you
14:06
know, what we're doing here is so
14:07
incredible. Now, listen, I'm just going
14:08
to tell you about two of my personal
14:10
favorites, the Bounties and Content
14:11
Rewards app. But I recommend just go
14:13
around, play, have some fun with it.
14:15
There's so many options when it comes to
14:16
apps that we've created inside of **Whop**. So,
14:19
let's start off with bounties. Now, the
14:20
Bounties app is one of the most unique
14:22
and powerful features on the **Whop** platform,
14:24
allowing you to pay users for completing
14:26
specific tasks. Now, as **Whop** co-owner, I've
14:28
seen this app drive exponential growth
14:30
for creators by turning community
14:32
members into active participants in
14:34
building the business. Some key features
14:36
here, you can incentivize actions, for
14:38
example, pay members for social media
14:39
shoutouts, success stories, content
14:41
creation, or any task you can imagine.
14:43
Or you can actually have discovery in
14:44
the marketplace visibility. Your
14:46
bounties appear on **Whop’s** discover page
14:48
sorted by highest payouts. And you can
14:50
actually see some bounties right here.
14:52
Now, let's move on to content rewards.
14:54
The content rewards app is a tool that
14:55
allows creators, influencers, streamers,
14:57
and brands to incentivize content
14:58
creation by paying users for generating
15:00
short form content about their brand or
15:02
content. So, here's how it works.
15:03
Creators pay users a set rate, for
15:04
example, let's say a dollar per thousand
15:06
views. Users then create short clips
15:08
from the creator's original content.
15:09
Creators only pay for views actually
15:11
generated. And then creators can set max
15:13
payout limits to control cost. And this
15:15
actually is very cool because this
15:16
allows you to get user generated content
15:19
very quickly as well as expand your
15:20
reach across platforms. Now creators
15:22
also have the power to set specific
15:23
guidelines that ensure the generated
15:25
content meets their brand standards. So
15:27
they can for example include technical
15:29
specifications like minimum video
15:30
length, mandatory watermarks, and
15:32
require links to the original content.
15:34
Now the approval process gives creators
15:36
complete control over the content
15:37
ecosystem. By personally reviewing each
15:39
submission, creators can approve or deny
15:41
clips that don't meet their standards.
15:43
And this approach means that only
15:44
highquality brand aligned content makes
15:46
the cut. Listen, I'm sure you guys have
15:48
seen everything I've done over the space
15:49
of the last couple years when it comes
15:51
to short form and you know my own
15:52
internal short form department. And at
15:54
one point I was spending a quarter
15:56
million a month on that short form
15:58
department. I had about 60 full-time
16:00
people just in that department alone.
16:01
And when I say full-time, I mean like
16:03
full full-time like daily team huddles.
16:05
Now, since then, we've gotten the
16:06
efficiency a lot better. We've gotten
16:07
the cost down, all that stuff. But
16:08
nonetheless, unlike me, who's I'm not
16:10
joking, has literally spent millions and
16:12
millions and millions of dollars on his
16:13
own internal short form department.
16:15
We've literally just built that function
16:16
out on **Whop**. Now, I will be very honest
16:18
with you, it's a one of our new
16:19
features. So, it's still rolling out.
16:20
There's a lot more people who are
16:22
joining that as time goes on. I'll
16:24
always be very honest with where our
16:25
products are at, what we're strong at,
16:26
what we're not strong at. It's amazing.
16:28
We've had some of the biggest artists,
16:29
like musical artists in the world,
16:31
literally have their album roll out
16:32
using content rewards on **Whop**. But, as I
16:34
said, it's one of our newer divisions,
16:35
so it's still being built out. Now, step
16:37
number three, get set up on **Whop**
16:39
marketplace. Leverage the marketplace.
16:40
The **Whop** marketplace is a gold mine for
16:42
customer acquisition with 2 million
16:43
weekly visitors actively looking for
16:45
products like yours. There are three
16:47
main spaces on the marketplace. So,
16:49
first things first, you have explore
16:50
page, then you have leaderboards, and
16:52
then finally, you have for you. Now,
16:55
your primary goal should be becoming a
16:56
category leader within the leaderboard
16:58
section to maximize organic discovery.
17:01
Within each category, **Whops** are ranked
17:02
based on most addicting. So, this is a
17:04
list of **Whops** ordered by the most time
17:06
spent inside the **Whop** for each user over
17:08
the last 24 hours. Reviews. This is a
17:10
list of **Whops** ordered by the most reviews
17:12
over the last 7 days. Newest. This is a
17:14
list of the newest **Whops** to the
17:15
marketplace. Bounties available. This is
17:17
a list of **Whops** that allow you to complete
17:18
tasks in exchange for money. Hot
17:20
affiliate deals. This is a list of **Whops**
17:22
ordered by the most affiliate earnings
17:23
over the last 24 hours. Most money made.
17:25
This is a list of **Whops** that have made
17:26
the most amount of money in the last 24
17:28
hours. So, if you are one of the best
17:29
**Whops** in your category, people are going
17:31
to find it. So, your main goal is just
17:33
to make a product, get customers, and
17:35
get good reviews. So, that way you can
17:37
rank highest in your category. Now, some
17:39
additional acquisition strategies. There
17:41
are really two main strategies I see
17:42
users crushing with. The first is
17:44
activate affiliate marketing. You see,
17:45
perhaps the most powerful customer
17:46
acquisition method is **Whop’s** affiliate
17:48
system. Now, once again, a little bit
17:50
more insider information. As the co
17:51
owner of **Whop** I can tell you that
17:53
virtually all of the top performing **Whops**
17:55
on the marketplace have their affiliate
17:57
programs activated. The most successful
17:59
creators understand that building an
18:00
army of promoters who are incentivized
18:02
by commissions is the fastest way to
18:04
scale your customer acquisition. To take
18:06
advantage of this, turn on affiliates at
18:07
the bottom of your store page. As you
18:09
can see right here, set the commission
18:10
rate and as well as add your best
18:12
content to your content folder. Next is
18:14
create a content funnel. Create short
18:16
form content to build top offunnel
18:18
awareness. Short form content on
18:19
platforms like Tik Tok and Instagram
18:20
reels is really your gateway to reaching
18:22
new audiences very quickly. These
18:24
algorithms can catapult even new
18:26
creators to massive audiences when you
18:28
focus on psychological hooks that
18:30
capture attention streamline information
18:32
that delivers quick value, clear
18:33
connection to your **Whop’s** main benefit, as
18:35
well as a consistent posting schedule.
18:37
Now, once you've captured attention with
18:38
short form, direct viewers to your long
18:40
form content on YouTube or podcast. This
18:42
is really where you establish deep
18:43
authority in your niche, building the
18:44
trust necessary for conversion. Every
18:46
piece of content should move viewers
18:48
closer to understanding why your **Whop** is
18:50
the logical next step in their journey.
18:52
And then you want to funnel people to
18:53
your products. This two-step content
18:55
approach creates a natural pathway for
18:57
audience to discover, trust, and then
18:59
ultimately purchase your **Whop** products.
19:01
Once again, as owner, and the reason
19:03
I keep writing this here is cuz I'm just
19:04
trying to let you know as a person who
19:06
actively sees what is working day in day
19:08
out. I can just be honest with you and I
19:09
can tell you, hey, this is working
19:10
really well right now. So maybe this is
19:12
something you want to focus on. So, all
19:13
that to say that behind the scenes when
19:14
I look at the metrics, I am not
19:16
surprised to find that virtually all
19:17
**Whops** generating significant revenue are
19:19
run by creators who take content
19:21
creation and posting extremely
19:22
seriously. Step number four, optimize
19:24
your **Whop**. You see, now that you've built
19:25
your foundation, it's time to implement
19:27
the high lever strategies that separate
19:29
six-figure earners from everyone else.
19:31
Now, these optimization methods focus on
19:33
three critical metrics: conversion rate,
19:35
retention, as well as average customer
19:36
value. When you systematically implement
19:38
each strategy, you're going to create
19:40
multiple leverage points that compound
19:41
your growth and help you reach that
19:43
$100,000 a month milestone. So, let's
19:45
talk about automated messaging system.
19:46
You see, when users take specific
19:48
actions, you can trigger automated
19:50
messages that positively impact user
19:52
experience and conversion rate. For
19:53
example, user join messages. When
19:55
someone joins your **Whop**, they're excited
19:57
but often confused where to start.
19:58
Welcome messages that automatically
20:00
trigger upon joining will establish you
20:01
as a point of content. For example, if
20:03
you have a question, DM me here. Guide
20:05
them to the most important resources
20:06
first. Help them find courses or
20:08
understand how forums work. Make them
20:09
feel welcome with a personal touch.
20:11
That's very important when you have
20:12
communities with thousands of members.
20:13
Create dedicated admin accounts for
20:15
these messages. This will just keep you
20:16
on top of things. Next, user left
20:18
message. You see, when someone cancels
20:20
their membership, this is a critical
20:21
moment to gather information and also
20:23
potentially win them back. Request
20:24
specific feedback to improve your
20:25
product. You can even run a win back
20:27
sequence. Okay? So, let's say, for
20:28
example, you offer 20% off the next
20:31
month. And then also lastly, just thank
20:33
them for their time because yeah, maybe
20:34
they cancel their subscription now, but
20:36
that doesn't mean that in your long
20:37
career, they're never going to come back
20:38
or they're never going to buy more that
20:39
you have to offer or what you have to
20:41
sell. And it's funny, offboarding a lot
20:43
of times is just as important as
20:44
onboarding because once again, it leaves
20:46
the door open for them to come back and
20:48
be customers for something else that you
20:49
sell. Next, you have new lead messages.
20:51
You see, for visitors who viewed your
20:52
store page but didn't complete checkout,
20:54
**Whop** allows you to re-engage them. Okay,
20:56
here you can track your store visitors.
20:58
**Whop** actually lets you see who viewed
21:00
your store page but didn't purchase.
21:02
Next is address potential objections.
21:03
They might have one or two questions
21:05
that they weren't sure about that your
21:06
store page didn't answer. Odds are your
21:08
product will help them and they just
21:09
need a little bit more information. Next
21:11
is enable pop-up discounts for visitors
21:13
who spend 30 to 45 seconds on their
21:15
store page. Last is create urgency.
21:16
These limited time offers can be the
21:18
final push that someone needs to
21:19
convert. This could literally be the
21:21
thing that makes or breaks this person
21:22
joining your **Whop** and actually deciding
21:24
to spend money with you. This is an
21:25
incredible tool to boost conversions.
21:27
And yeah, maybe it might only add a few
21:29
extra percentage points, but as you
21:31
know, at scale, that means so much. So,
21:33
by the way, on the discount strategies,
21:35
you've got pop-up discounts. As I
21:37
mentioned, **Whop’s** pop-up discount feature
21:38
is a very simple but effective way to
21:40
convert visitors who are on the fence
21:42
about joining. By the way, you've also
21:43
got private affiliate links. Let's say
21:44
you want to give an influencer with a
21:46
big audience a special deal. Private
21:47
affiliate links are perfect way to do
21:49
this. While you can set up public
21:50
affiliate links that anyone can use, so
21:52
that way you just go to store page, hit
21:53
edit affiliate, set the reward, and turn
21:55
it on. Private affiliate links let you
21:57
create custom arrangements. Now all you
21:59
do is you just input the influencers's
22:01
email and choose their percentage.
22:02
Instead of public 60%, maybe you want to
22:04
give them 80% of recurring payments
22:06
because it's a strategic partnership and
22:07
you just decide that, you know, for you
22:09
the brand awareness is worth it with
22:10
that specific individual. Once again, I
22:12
hope you're starting to see the general
22:13
theme of what it is that we focus on and
22:15
what it is that we do. We just want to
22:16
give you options because we understand
22:17
that you as a business owner in your
22:19
position, you want options. Your
22:21
businesses are not cookie cutter. Your
22:22
businesses are not the same. And
22:23
unfortunately, as you're very aware with
22:24
a lot of the other platforms, they treat
22:26
you all the same. They think you have
22:28
the same business model selling the same
22:29
price point, same pricing model, and
22:31
you're simply boxed in and it feels like
22:33
you're living in a chat form from 15
22:36
years ago. It's ridiculous. And as a
22:37
business owner in the digital product,
22:39
in the info product, you know, coaching,
22:41
consulting, you know, even agency space,
22:43
community, membership space, you know,
22:44
whatever it is, you deserve options and
22:46
that's what we give you. All right. Now,
22:47
going back to the presentation, once you
22:49
put in their email and set this up, it
22:50
creates a private affiliate link just
22:51
for this person. This actually gives
22:53
them extra incentive to promote your **Whop**
22:54
because they're going to get special
22:56
percentage that's higher than what
22:57
everyone else gets. Next, bespoke link
22:59
creation. If you are a high ticket coach
23:01
or agency with custom pricing, you need
23:03
checkout links. And if you want to know
23:04
which marketing channel works best,
23:06
tracking links are your answer. Checkout
23:08
links let you create private customized
23:10
payment options not visible on your
23:11
store page. Once again, this is perfect
23:13
if you have different prices for
23:15
different clients. If you're an agency
23:16
selling marketing service, you might
23:17
charge $1,500 for logo and an ad, but
23:20
$8,000 for five videos as a package
23:22
deal. Now, the customer never sees the
23:24
store page. They just get a direct
23:25
checkout link for your specific price.
23:27
And you can create thousands of these to
23:28
literally charge any amount instantly.
23:30
Now, let's talk about tracking links.
23:31
Let's say you want to know if your
23:32
YouTube channel or Instagram is bringing
23:34
in more customers. Tracking links can
23:35
show you exactly that. Now, you can see
23:37
which platforms give you the best
23:38
conversion rate. Maybe YouTube is at
23:40
10%, emails at 30%, and Instagram is
23:42
only 3%. This shows you exactly where to
23:44
focus your efforts. Once again, even if
23:46
you use external tools, let's say for
23:47
example, something like a ClickFunnels,
23:48
and you want to use **Whop** simply for the
23:50
payment side of things and for the
23:51
checkout links, you can do that. You
23:53
have the flexibility and the freedom.
23:54
And there we go, my friend. There you
23:56
have it. I just gave you the exact
23:57
strategies you can use to hit $100,000 a
24:00
month on **Whop**. And I hope you get a ton of
24:02
value from these insider tactics. Keep
24:04
your eyes on what we are doing because
24:05
we've got some major moves coming that I
24:07
can tell you quite frankly no one is
24:09
expecting. And once again, as always, if
24:11
you want to see exactly how we're
24:12
executing this at the highest level and
24:14
how you can take advantage of it, we
24:15
always give the most favorable terms,
24:17
the most VIP white glove service to our
24:19
8 figureure licensed private clients. Me
24:21
coming in and making a major investment
24:22
in **Whop** has been incredible. And by the
24:24
way, if you want to find out more about
24:25
**Whop**, find out how we could help your
24:27
specific situation and you are a
24:29
business that's doing more than $25,000
24:31
a month with digital products.
24:32
Unfortunately, that is the only
24:34
requirement. I'm actually going to leave
24:35
a link in the description where you can
24:36
book in a direct call with one of our
24:38
heads of partnership. For me, it was
24:40
always incredibly important that like if
24:42
you're working with a platform, they're
24:43
really like your partner in this and
24:44
they're helping you not only service the
24:46
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
24:48
dollars you're making here as well as
24:49
facilitating all the payments. And
24:50
that's a big thing. So, you want to have
24:51
that sort of MX black card service, you
24:53
know, where if there's ever a problem,
24:55
there's a real human. You don't have to,
24:56
you know, email support or all this
24:58
crap. So, once again, I'll leave a link
24:59
in the description. We'll speak to an
25:00
actual human that's sat in our New York
25:02
offices. And by the way, even if you're
25:03
just 1% interested on what we can do on
25:05
